# Coding Practices

**Notice:** generated with AI (google-labs-jules)

This section covers best practices and common patterns for writing robust and maintainable Go code. Adhering to these practices will help you and your team build better software.

## Effective Go

The most important document for understanding idiomatic Go is "[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)". It provides a comprehensive guide to writing clear, idiomatic Go code. Key takeaways include:
- **Formatting:** Use `gofmt` to automatically format your code. This ensures consistency across all Go projects.
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow standard naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for local variables, `PascalCase` for exported identifiers).
- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, straightforward code.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors explicitly; don't ignore them.
- **Concurrency:** Understand how to use goroutines and channels effectively and safely.

## Date and Time: The `time` Package

Go's standard library provides the `time` package for all date and time operations.

- **`time.Time`:** Represents a specific moment in time.
- **`time.Duration`:** Represents a duration between two points in time.
- **Parsing and Formatting:** Use `time.Parse` and `Time.Format` for converting between string representations and `time.Time` objects. Go uses a unique reference-based layout string (Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006) instead of traditional format codes.
- **Time Zones:** The `time` package handles time zones, including `time.Local` and `time.UTC`.
- **Timers and Tickers:** `time.NewTimer` and `time.NewTicker` for scheduling events.

## Design Patterns in Go

While Go isn't a traditional object-oriented language, many design patterns are still applicable, often with a Go-specific flavor.

- **Interfaces:** Used extensively for decoupling and polymorphism (e.g., `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`).
- **Functional Options Pattern:** A common way to provide optional arguments to constructors or functions.
- **Middleware:** Popular in web servers for processing HTTP requests in a chain.
- **Factory Pattern:** Useful for creating objects when the exact type isn't known until runtime.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Can be implemented using `sync.Once` for thread-safe initialization.

It's important to use patterns judiciously and prioritize Go's idiomatic simplicity.

## Working with UTF-8

Go has excellent built-in support for UTF-8, which is the default encoding for strings.

- **Strings are UTF-8 encoded:** When you iterate over a string with a `for...range` loop, you get individual Unicode code points (runes).
- **`rune` type:** An alias for `int32`, it represents a Unicode code point.
- **`unicode/utf8` package:** Provides functions for working with UTF-8 encoded text (e.g., `utf8.RuneCountInString`, `utf8.ValidString`).

## Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

Internationalization is the process of designing software so it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

Go doesn't have a single, built-in i18n/l10n framework like some other languages, but there are excellent libraries and tools available:

- **`golang.org/x/text`:** This package provides a collection of text-related functionality, including support for locales, message catalogs, and language-specific formatting. It's a powerful, low-level toolkit.
- **Third-Party Libraries:**
    - [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n): A popular library for handling message translation.
    - [i18n](https://github.com/leonelquinteros/i18n): Another library for Go localization.

Strategies often involve:
- Storing translations in files (JSON, YAML, TOML, gettext .po files).
- Using unique keys for strings in your application.
- Loading the appropriate translation set based on user preference or locale.
