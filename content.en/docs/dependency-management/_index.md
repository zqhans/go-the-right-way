# Dependency Management

**Notice:** generated with AI (google-labs-jules)

Go has a built-in system for managing dependencies called Go Modules. This system allows you to specify the versions of packages your project depends on, ensuring reproducible builds.

## Go Modules

Go Modules are the official dependency management solution for Go projects. Introduced in Go 1.11, they are now the standard and recommended way to handle dependencies.

A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a `go.mod` file at its root. The `go.mod` file defines:
- The module's own path (its unique identifier).
- The minimum version of Go required for the module.
- The list of direct dependencies and their versions.
- Replacement directives (optional, for using forks or local copies).
- Exclude directives (optional, for excluding specific versions of dependencies).

### Key Concepts and Files:

- **`go.mod`:** This file is the heart of a Go module. It's created when you initialize a new module with `go mod init <module-path>`. It tracks your project's dependencies.
  ```
  module example.com/myproject

  go 1.18

  require (
      github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.7
      github.com/spf13/cobra v1.4.0
  )

  // Example of an indirect dependency
  require (
  	github.com/gin-contrib/sse v0.1.0 // indirect
  	github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 v10.10.0 // indirect
  )
  ```

- **`go.sum`:** This file is automatically generated and maintained alongside `go.mod`. It contains the cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions. This ensures that future downloads of these modules retrieve the same bits as the first download, protecting against accidental or malicious modifications.

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Go Modules work best with dependencies that follow semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

### Common `go mod` Commands:

- **`go mod init [module-path]`:** Initializes a new module in the current directory. The module path is typically your project's repository path (e.g., `github.com/username/project`).
- **`go get [package-path]`:** Adds a new dependency or updates an existing one. For example, `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin` will add Gin as a dependency. You can specify versions: `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.7.0`.
- **`go mod tidy`:** This is a crucial command. It analyzes your source code and updates the `go.mod` file to include only the direct and indirect dependencies that are actually used. It also adds any missing dependencies and removes unused ones. It ensures your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are accurate.
- **`go list -m all`:** Lists all the modules (dependencies) used in the current module.
- **`go mod vendor`:** Creates a `vendor` directory in your module's root and copies all dependencies into it. This allows for offline builds or ensuring you have a local copy of all dependencies. Builds will then use the vendored packages by default if the `vendor` directory exists.
- **`go mod why [package-path]`:** Explains why a particular package is a dependency.

### Private Repositories

Go modules can also work with private repositories. You'll typically need to configure your environment (e.g., `GOPRIVATE` environment variable, Git credentials) to allow Go tools to fetch private modules.
