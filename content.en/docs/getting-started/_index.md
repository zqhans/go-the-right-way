# Getting Started

## Use the latest release version(Go 1.24)

If you are new to Go, using the latest release version of Go is highly recommend, take anvantage of the newest language features, security fixes etc.

While Go does not have "Long Term Support" (LTS) designation like other programming languages do. It has a clear and consistent [release policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). Only support the two most recent major releases officially. For product enviroments, running on  one of the two most recent major releases is the recommended practice.
