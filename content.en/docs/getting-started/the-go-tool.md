- `go install`: Builds and installs executable commands and libraries.  
- `go mod init`: Initializes a new module in the current directory.  
- `go mod tidy`: Adds missing module requirements and removes unused ones.  
- `go get`: Adds, updates, or downloads dependencies.  
- `go test`: Runs tests for Go packages.
