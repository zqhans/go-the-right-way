# Getting Started with Go

Welcome to the Getting Started guide for Go! This section will help you set up your Go development environment and understand some basic concepts.

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming.

## Use the Current Stable Version

It's always recommended to use the latest stable version of Go. You can find the latest releases and installation instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). Go maintains a release policy and provides tools to manage Go versions.

## Go's HTTP Server Capabilities

Go's standard library includes the powerful `net/http` package, which allows you to build robust HTTP servers and clients. For simple use cases, the standard library is often sufficient. For more complex applications, you might consider using a web framework.

## Installing Go

Setting up Go on your system is straightforward.

### macOS Setup
Detailed instructions for installing Go on macOS can be found at [Installing Go on macOS](https://golang.org/doc/install#macos). You can typically use Homebrew or download the official installer.

### Windows Setup
Detailed instructions for installing Go on Windows can be found at [Installing Go on Windows](https://golang.org/doc/install#windows). Download the MSI installer from the Go website.

### Linux Setup
Detailed instructions for installing Go on Linux can be found at [Installing Go on Linux](https://golang.org/doc/install#linux). You can download the tarball and extract it, or use your distribution's package manager.

## Workspace and Module Structure

Go has a well-defined project structure.
- **GOPATH (Legacy):** Historically, Go used a `GOPATH` environment variable to define a workspace containing source code, compiled packages, and executables.
- **Go Modules (Recommended):** Since Go 1.11, modules are the standard way to manage dependencies and structure projects. A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a `go.mod` file at its root. This file defines the moduleâ€™s path and its dependencies.

It is highly recommended to use Go Modules for new projects.
